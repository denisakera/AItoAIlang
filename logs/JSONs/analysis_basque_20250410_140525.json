  "analysis": "1. **Agency Expression**\n   - The agency is articulated through references to collective entities such as \"korporazio handiak\" (large corporations), \"gobernuak eta erakunde publikoak\" (governments and public institutions), and \"gizartea\" (society). These references highlight institutional and collective actors as primary agents in the discourse.\n   - Pronouns like \"gure\" (our) and \"guztiontzat\" (for everyone) indicate a sense of group belonging and shared responsibility, suggesting a collective concern for the common good.\n   - The voice is predominantly active, particularly when discussing the actions and responsibilities of corporations and governments, e.g., \"gobernuek... araudiak ezarriz\" (governments establishing regulations).\n\n2. **Responsibility Framing**\n   - Responsibility is framed in moral, legal, and distributed terms. There is an emphasis on ethical obligations (\"etika eta giza eskubideak bermatuko dituzten\") and the need for legal frameworks (\"araudi garbia eta zehatza ezarri\").\n   - Obligation and accountability are expressed through language that implies necessity and duty, such as \"garrantzitsua da\" (it is important) and \"behar dute\" (they must).\n   - Assumptions about who is answerable are both implicit and explicit, often focusing on corporations' duty to protect data and governments' role in regulation.\n\n3. **Values and Norms**\n   - Ethical values like \"etika\" (ethics), \"gardentasuna\" (transparency), and \"giza eskubideak\" (human rights) are promoted, reflecting a commitment to fairness and accountability.\n   - Culturally specific ideals such as \"demokratizazioa\" (democratization) and \"sarbide unibertsala\" (universal access) are emphasized, indicating a value placed on inclusivity and equal opportunity.\n   - Metaphors and references to \"oreka\" (balance) illustrate the ideal of maintaining equilibrium between openness and control.\n\n4. **Decision-Making Patterns**\n   - Decisions are represented as a balance between consensus and hierarchy, with suggestions of both collective involvement and authoritative regulation.\n   - Language reflects negotiation and participation, highlighting public-private partnerships (\"eremu publiko-pribatuak elkarlanean\") and collaborative development models.\n   - Choices are framed as strategic options, with open-source models and hybrid frameworks presented as viable paths forward.\n\n5. **Cultural and Institutional Markers**\n   - Specific institutions like \"korporazioak\" (corporations), \"gobernuak\" (governments), and \"erakunde publikoak\" (public institutions) are referenced, highlighting their roles in AI governance.\n   - Culturally embedded terms such as \"kode irekia\" (open-source) and \"ikerketa\" (research) illustrate the discourse's focus on innovation and collaboration.\n   - Concepts like \"algoritmoen gardentasuna\" (algorithm transparency) may be difficult to translate directly, reflecting localized understandings of accountability and oversight. \n\nThe text situates AI development within a framework of ethical responsibility, emphasizing the need for balanced approaches that incorporate both openness and centralized control to benefit society as a whole."
