You are an expert in linguistics, political theory, and public policy analysis.  
Your task is a detailed cultural and rhetorical analysis of the following text.  
Focus on deixis, institutional references, rhetorical structure, and cultural context.  

Structure your response under these five clear section headers, each with bullet-pointed examples quoted or paraphrased from the text:

1. Agency Expression  
   • How is collective or institutional agency articulated?  
   • Which pronouns and deixis markers signal group belonging or authority?  
   • Where does the voice shift between active and passive?

2. Responsibility Framing  
   • How is responsibility framed (technical, moral, legal, distributed)?  
   • What linguistic forms express obligation or accountability?  
   • Are implicit assumptions made about who must answer?

3. Values and Norms  
   • What ethical or social values are asserted or assumed?  
   • Which terms or metaphors reflect culturally specific ideals?  
   • How do these reveal community norms?

4. Decision-Making Patterns  
   • How are decisions depicted (consensus, delegation, imposition)?  
   • What forms of participation, hierarchy, or negotiation appear?  
   • How are choices justified (necessity, duty, strategy)?

5. Cultural and Institutional Markers  
   • Which institutions, social groups, or political actors are named?  
   • What idioms or context-bound expressions appear?  
   • Which concepts resist direct translation?

Respond only with that structured analysis, no summary or extraneous text.
