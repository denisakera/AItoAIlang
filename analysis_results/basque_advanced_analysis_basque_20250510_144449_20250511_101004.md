### Agency Expression
- Institutional agency is articulated through the references to "korporazio batzuek" (a few corporations), indicating a collective group with control over the artificial intelligence infrastructure.
- Deixis markers such as "gizarte osoa" (the whole society) and "komunitatea" (the community) signal group belonging and highlight a broader social collective.
- The voice shifts between active and passive, especially in the discussion of potential actions by corporations ("kontrolatu beharko lukete" - should control) versus the societal benefits of open infrastructure ("berrikuntza sustatzen du" - promotes innovation).

### Responsibility Framing
- Responsibility is framed as both a technical and moral issue, with centralized control being justified by "espezializazioa bermatzen" (ensuring specialization) and open infrastructure by "gizarte osoaren mesedetan" (for the benefit of the whole society).
- Obligations and accountability are expressed through terms like "bermatu" (ensure) and "erantzukizun" (responsibility), suggesting a moral duty to both innovate and protect.
- Implicit assumptions about who must answer include corporations for potential monopolization and society for fostering innovative and ethical use of AI.

### Values and Norms
- Ethical and social values such as transparency ("gardentasuna"), innovation ("berrikuntza"), and democracy ("demokrazia") are asserted.
- Metaphors reflecting culturally specific ideals include "berrikuntza demokratikoa" (democratic innovation) and "gizartearen onurarako" (for society's benefit), highlighting ideals of inclusivity and shared progress.
- Community norms are revealed through the emphasis on shared benefits and the dangers of power concentration, indicative of a preference for egalitarian and participatory approaches.

### Decision-Making Patterns
- Decisions are depicted as potentially arising through consensus or imposition, with centralized control framed as an imposition and open infrastructure as promoting consensus ("lankidetza sustatuko lirateke" - collaboration would be encouraged).
- Participation and hierarchy appear as polarized options, with open infrastructure highlighting community involvement and corporate control emphasizing hierarchical efficiency.
- Choices are justified through strategy ("koordinazio eta garapen azkarra" - quick coordination and development) and moral duty ("guztion mesedetan" - for everyone's benefit).

### Cultural and Institutional Markers
- Institutions such as "korporazioak" (corporations) and social groups like "gizartea" (society) are named, indicating key actors in the debate.
- Context-bound expressions like "misio publikoaren desbideraketa" (diversion of public mission) and "justizia digitala" (digital justice) carry cultural nuances that may resist direct translation, reflecting specific socio-political concerns within the context.
- Concepts such as "demokrazia teknologikoa" (technological democracy) highlight a blending of traditional democratic values with modern technological contexts, underscoring the cultural integration of these spheres.
